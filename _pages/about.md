Hi! I am a researcher working in the areas of deep learning, data mining, information and social network analysis, and reinforcement learning. In January of 2020, I will be joining the [Core Data Science](https://research.fb.com/core-data-science/) team at [Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com/). Previously, I was a graduate student at [WPI](https://www.wpi.edu/) in the Computer Science Departmentâ€”where I had the privilege of working under the supervision of [Prof. Xiangnan Kong](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/).
